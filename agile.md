# Agil manifesto
- Individual and interactions over processes and tools
    - Team communication
    - Daily standups
    - Retrospectives
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
    - Test-driven development
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    - Everyone is on the same team
- Responding to change over following a plan
    - Recognize plan's inaccuracies
    - Task board (agile planning tool)
